## Project Objective
---
The goal of this project is to leverage Power BI for interactive visualizations and in-depth insights to understand patterns, contributing factors and trends in aviation incidents. The analysis aims to provide stakeholders with valuable information for enhancing avaiation safety and mitigating risks.

## Problem Statement
---
1. Temporal Analysis
   - Explore temporal trends in airplane crashes over the years.
   - Identify patterns in the frequency and severity of incidents.
2. Geospatial Analysis
   - Visualize crash locations on a map to identify hotspots.
   - Analyse the distribution of incidents across different regions.
3. Operator Performance
   - Evaluate the safety records of different operators and airlines.
   - Identify operators with higher incident rates.
4. Aircraft Analysis
   - Analyse the involvement of specific aircraft types in incidents.
   - Examine the relationship between aircraft registration and crash occurrences.
5.  Fatality Trends
    - Explore trends in passenger and crew fatalities.
    - Investigate factors contributing to fatalities.
6. Route Analysis
    - Analyse incident patterns on specific flight routes.
    - Identify routes with a higher likelihood of incidents.
