## Project Objective
---
The goal of this project is to leverage Power BI for interactive visualizations and in-depth insights to understand patterns, contributing factors and trends in aviation incidents. The analysis aims to provide stakeholders with valuable information for enhancing avaiation safety and mitigating risks.

## Data Source

The date used for this analysis is the 'Airplane Crashes Analysis.csv' dataset.


## Problem Statement
---
1. Temporal Analysis
   - Explore temporal trends in airplane crashes over the years.
   - Identify patterns in the frequency and severity of incidents.
2. Geospatial Analysis
   - Visualize crash locations on a map to identify hotspots.
   - Analyse the distribution of incidents across different regions.
3. Operator Performance
   - Evaluate the safety records of different operators and airlines.
   - Identify operators with higher incident rates.
4. Aircraft Analysis
   - Analyse the involvement of specific aircraft types in incidents.
   - Examine the relationship between aircraft registration and crash occurrences.
5.  Fatality Trends
    - Explore trends in passenger and crew fatalities.
    - Investigate factors contributing to fatalities.
6. Route Analysis
    - Analyse incident patterns on specific flight routes.
    - Identify routes with a higher likelihood of incidents.
      
## Deliverables
The report entails two pages:

**1. Report on operator Performance, aircraft involvement and fatality traits**

## Visulaization Analysis

1. The overall analysis portrays crew analysis to be higher compared to passenger analysis. This could be because the crewâ€™s actions, decisions and overall performance are critical in preventing or causing incidents. Their focus is always at the safety of the passenger.

2. The training route presents to have the highest recording of incidents, followed by site seeing route and test flight routes.
   - The training route presenting the highest incidents can be attributed to the nature of training flights. Pilots at this phase are still training and learning on how to handle             aircrafts which may present near-misses and consequently the higher incidents.
   - The sightseeing route being next in terms of crash incidents might be due to inexperienced pilots operating in unfamiliar or challenging terrains.
   - Test-flight routes also presents a high risk because it involves testing new flights and conducting performance checks which can introduce unforeseen technical issues.

3. The year 1940 presented to have the least number of airplane crashes with 1946 presenting to have the highest number of recorded cases to have ever occurred(88 cases). However, over      the years the cases have been fluctuating with only 3 cases recorded in 2023.

4. The map analysis shows that Canada is most affected recording the highest crash incidents to have happened in that location. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that the         country experiences extreme weather conditions such as heavy snow fall which may increase the risk of aviation incidents.

5. According to the operator analysis, military operators presented to have the highest recording of plane crash incidents. This is highly correlated to the fact that the training route     also presented the high record of crash incidents. Military usually engage in high risk missions and tactical training exercises. These operations are riskier than commercial or          general aviation flights.
